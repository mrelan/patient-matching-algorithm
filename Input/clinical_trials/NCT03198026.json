Monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving obinutuzumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab in chemotherapy naive patients with indolent lymphomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess progression free survival rates and overall survival rates in indolent lymphomas.\n\nII. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination. III. To evaluate response using positron emission tomography (PET) and correlate PET negativity with durability of response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 months after cycle 6, patients with stable disease will continue to receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for a total of 12 doses.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year, every 3-6 months for 4 years, and then 1 year later."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage II Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma of Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue","Ann Arbor Stage II Follicular Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage II Nodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma","Ann Abor Stage III B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage III Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma of Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue","Ann Arbor Stage III Follicular Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage III Nodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage IV B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage IV Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma of Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue","Ann Arbor Stage IV Follicular Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage IV Nodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma","Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma","Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma","Grade 3a Follicular Lymphoma","Indolent Non-hodgkin Lymphoma","Stage II Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma","Stage III Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma","Stage IV Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previously untreated, histologically confirmed indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as follows:\n\n  * Follicular lymphoma (World Health Organization \\[WHO\\] classification grade 1, 2, or 3a)\n  * Marginal zone lymphoma including:\n\n    * Nodal and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have an indication for systemic therapy\n    * Extranodal MZL:\n\n      * Nongastric/noncutaneous MZL requiring systemic therapy\n      * Cutaneous MZL will be eligible only if they have pathologically confirmed extra-cutaneous disease\n      * Gastric MZL only if stage IIIE/IV defined as lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm or with disseminated extranodal disease such as bone marrow or additional extra nodal sites\n* Pathological diagnosis should be obtained by incisional or excisional tissue biopsy; core biopsy is permissible if obtaining an incisional or excisional is not possible and if the grade can be assessed on the core biopsy; a core biopsy can also be used if deemed in the best interest of the patient in the opinion of the investigator\n* Patients must have stage II-IV disease\n* All patients should have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined as a lymph node or tumor mass that is \\>= 1.5 cm in at least one dimension by computed tomography (CT) or the CT portion of the PET/CT\n* Documentation of CD20+ status\n* Patients must have an indication for therapy per standard modified Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) criteria including:\n\n  * Symptoms attributable to lymphoma\n  * B symptoms\n  * Threatened end-organ function\n  * Pleural effusions or peritoneal ascites\n  * Cytopenia secondary to lymphoma\n  * Leukemia\n  * Bulky disease (defined as: Single mass \\>7cm in diameter, or 3 or more masses \\> 3 cm in diameter)\n  * Splenomegaly\n  * And steady progression over at least 6 months\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2\n* Patients must be able to swallow whole pills\n* Ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the study protocol; when it is determined by the study investigator that a potential research participant is cognitively impaired, a surrogate consent from a caregiver or legally-authorized representative will be obtained.
