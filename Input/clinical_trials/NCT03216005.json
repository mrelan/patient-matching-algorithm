The BlueLeaf System is designed to form autogenous tissue leaflets from vein walls in the femoral and popliteal veins without the use of a permanent vascular implant for the treatment of CVI. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled and may be followed through 5 years post treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Venous Insufficiency"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Symptomatic CVI subjects, Clinical Etiological Anatomical Pathophysiological (CEAP) grade 3 to 6;\n* Failed compression therapy of at least 6 months' duration;\n* Deep system venous reflux characterized by \\>1 second reflux time;\n* Presence of at least one target site within the target vessel.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Untreated significant superficial venous incompetence which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be the primary source of existing symptoms;\n* Deep venous intervention in the target limb or outflow vessels within 6 months of consent;\n* Significant peripheral arterial disease with an ankle-brachial index of \\<0.50 or with incompressible vessels;\n* Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within 3 months of consent;\n* History of stroke within the last 6 months;\n* Flow-limiting venous outflow obstruction central to the intended target sites;\n* Insufficient inflow through the treatment vein upon manual augmentation;\n* Chronic, diffuse, post-thrombotic femoropopliteal vein disease that, in the Investigator's opinion, would preclude venous valve formation or would inhibit flow through the treatment sites;\n* Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine level of â‰¥2mg/dL;\n* Hemoglobin level \\<9.0 mg/dL;\n* Platelet count \\<50,000 or \\>1,000,000 per mm3;\n* Total white blood cell count \\<3,000/mm3;\n* Pregnant or lactating female; positive pregnancy test, women of childbearing potential must be tested;\n* Non-ambulatory patients;","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]}}}
