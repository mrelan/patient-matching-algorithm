In this phase I study, the safety, tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of the GPC3/Mesothelin/Claudin18.2/GUCY2C/B7-H3/PSCA/PSMA/MUC1/TGFβ/HER2/Lewis-Y/AXL/EGFR\n\n-CAR-T cell immunotherapy on human cancers will firstly be tested.","detailedDescription":"1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced lung or other cancers,with written consent for this study;\n2. Perform biopsy to determine the expression of HER2, Mesothelin, Lewis-Y, PSCA, MUC1, GPC3, AXL, EGFR, Claudin18.2, or B7-H3 of the tumor by western blotting or IHC;\n3. Collect blood from the patients and isolate mononuclear cells, activate the T cells and transfect the T cells with GPC3, Mesothelin, Claudin18.2, GUCY2C, B7-H3, PSCA, PSMA, MUC1, TGFβ, HER2, Lewis-Y, AXL, or EGFR targeting CAR, amplify the transfected T cells as needed, test the quality and killing activity of the CAR-T cells and then transfer them back the patients via systemic or local injections, and follow up closely to collect related results as needed;\n4. To enhance the killing capability, CD4+ T cells are genetically engineered to express TGFβ-CAR and secret IL7/CCL19 and/or SCFVs against PD1/CTLA4/Tigit; CD8+T cells are constructed to express GPC3/Mesothelin/Claudin18.2/GUCY2C/B7-H3/PSCA/PSMA/MUC1/TGFβ/HER2/Lewis-Y/AXL/EGFR\n\n   -DAP10-CAR with knockdown of PD1/HPK1;\n5. Other cancers with these cell surface antigen expressions are also recruited if needed;\n6. Evaluate the clinical results as needed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Cancer","Immunotherapy","CAR-T Cell"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
