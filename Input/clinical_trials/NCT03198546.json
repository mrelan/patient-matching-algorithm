Clinical studies will be performed to test the anti-cancer function by the GPC3/TGFβ-CAR-T cells in human HCC patients with GPC3 expression. In this phase I study, the safety, tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of the GPC3/TGFβ-CAR-T cell immunotherapy on human will firstly be tested.","detailedDescription":"1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,with written consent for this study;\n2. Perform biopsy to determine the expression of GPC3 of the tumor by western blotting or IHC;\n3. Collect blood from the patients and isolate mononuclear cells, activate the T cells and transfect the T cells with GPC3/TGFβ targeting CAR (or/and scfv/cytokines-secreting), amplify the number of transfected T cells as needed, test the quality and killing activity of the GPC3/TGFβ-CART cells and then transplant back the patients via systemic or local infusions (via artery or intra-tumor), and follow up closely to collect related results as needed;\n4. To enhance the killing capability, CD4+ T cells are genetically engineered to express TGFβ-CAR and secret IL7/CCL19 and/or SCFVs against PD1/CTLA4/Tigit; CD8+T cells are constructed to express GPC3-DAP10-CAR with knockdown of PD1/HPK1;\n5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.\n6. Will also perform the similar clinical trial on lung squamous carcinoma with the GPC3 expression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Immunotherapy","CAR","GPC3 Gene Inactivation","T Cell","Squamous Cell Lung Cancer"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. patients with advanced HCC,which express GPC3 protein.\n2.
