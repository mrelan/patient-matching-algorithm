(1) TTFields also have a role in the recurrent glioblastoma treatment where it has demonstrated equal efficacy to second-line chemotherapy also has been shown to tumor progression and improve overall survival.(2) Though preclinical studies are ongoing, glioblastoma patients who have undergone TTField therapy have not yet been assessed at autopsy to determine both the pathological signature of TTField treatment, and the pattern of failure. This study will determine how the underlying pathological signatures of tumors treated with TTFields differ from those na√Øve to TTFields by comparing tumor tissue at autopsy.\n\nSTUDY:\n\nAll patients undergoing TTField therapy for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma will be considered for inclusion for this study. The investigators expect to enroll five patients per year for four years, totaling 10 patients treated upfront and 10 patients treated at tumor recurrence. An objective of this study is to determine differences in the pathological pattern of failure when patients are treated with TTFields at initial diagnosis (up-front) compared to those treated at tumor recurrence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Glioblastoma"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Newly diagnosed glioblastoma, World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV, patients undergoing TTField therapy.\n* Recurrent glioblastoma WHO grade IV, patients undergoing TTField therapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* TTField compliance \\< 75%.\n* Any contraindication to Optune TTField treatment.\n* Initial brain tumor diagnosis \\< WHO grade IV.\n* Duration of TTField therapy \\< 3 months.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients undergoing standard of care treatment consisting of surgery followed by chemo-radiation therapy will have the addition of Optune TTField therapy together with adjuvant chemotherapy.
