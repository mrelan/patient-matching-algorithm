Some patients achieve a complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Considering that radiation therapy is an effective treatment for subclinical microscopic disease, the question arises whether breast surgery before radiation therapy can be avoided in the subgroup of patients with complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer","Radiation Therapy"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 40 years or older\n* Pathologically confirmed unicentric invasive breast cancer\n* Clinical stage T1-3 / N0 or N2 / M0\n* Clinical conditions to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior diagnosis of cancer (exception: in situ cervical tumor and non-melanoma skin)\n* Patient is known to be pregnant\n* Prior history of radiation therapy in the thoracic region\n* Impossibility to perform magnetic resonance imaging","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]}}}
