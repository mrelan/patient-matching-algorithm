In addition, treatment adherence, rehabilitation and return to work, primary care utilization, and survival will be monitored.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized controlled trial comparing a web-based psychosocial screening application to usual care in a cohort of surgically-treated head and neck cancer patients.\n\nThis study will utilize a web-based application available on desktop or laptop computers, and smartphones. The application involves monitoring using the NCCN Distress Thermometer Score, the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) score, and the Head and Neck Research Network (HNRN-33), a patient-reported, validated functional outcomes score. These assessments will be completed at baseline, 2 weeks postoperatively, and monthly thereafter until 12 months. Patients will have the option of filling out questionnaires more frequently if desired.\n\nThis web-based application, the NAPT App, will allow patients to alert the treatment team of their current state of mood or distress. Automatic alerts will be sent to the team if a Distress Score of \\</=3, a QIDS score \\>/=11, or suicidal ideation are expressed in the application.\n\nThe study duration will be 12 months with a primary endpoint of 6 months. Our primary outcome will be NCCN Distress Thermometer Score at 6 months, with secondary outcomes of the QIDS and HNRN-33 functional scores at 6 and 12 months. Additional outcomes assessed will pertain to completion of adjuvant therapy, weight maintenance, rehabilitation and return to work, and survival. Health services delivery outcomes, such as primary care visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and narcotic use will also be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer Distress"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18 years\n* New (non-recurrent) head and neck cancer\n* Primary surgical treatment\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* \\<18 years\n* Recurrent head and neck cancer\n* Previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy\n* History of psychiatric or psychologic illness\n* History of previous cancers or cancer distress","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]}}}
