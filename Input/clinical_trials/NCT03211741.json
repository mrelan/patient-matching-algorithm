This will allow the investigators to compare the results of their centre with the results of several phase 3 trials from the literature and will guide improvements in their treatment protocols."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Retinal Neovascularization","Macular Edema"]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
